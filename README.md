# IoT-Discussing-Watson-IoT-using-the-TJ-Bot
IBM Watson IoT (Internet of Things) provides a platform for managing IoT devices and creating smart applications. The TJ Bot is a great example of an IoT project powered by IBM Watson, where you can build a robot that interacts with the real world using speech, vision, and other sensors.

The TJ Bot is a simple robot created using Raspberry Pi and various sensors that can be controlled and enhanced using IBM Watson services, such as Watson Assistant, Watson Visual Recognition, and Watson IoT Platform. You can also use the TJ Bot SDK to make it easy to interact with the robot and enhance its abilities.
Prerequisites

    Raspberry Pi or a similar device with a camera and microphone.
    IBM Cloud Account: Sign up for an account if you don't have one.
    Watson IoT Platform: Create a Watson IoT service instance and get your credentials (API Key and URL).
    TJ Bot SDK: The TJ Bot SDK simplifies building IoT projects for Raspberry Pi with Watson services.
    Hardware Setup:
        Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS
        Camera for visual recognition (if using vision features)
        Microphone (for speech recognition)
        Speaker (for speech output)

Step 1: Set Up Your IBM Watson Services

You need to create several Watson services in your IBM Cloud account, such as:

    Watson IoT: To manage IoT devices.
    Watson Assistant (Optional): To make the TJ Bot interact with users via natural language.
    Watson Speech to Text & Text to Speech (Optional): For converting speech into text and generating speech from text.
    Watson Visual Recognition (Optional): If you want the TJ Bot to recognize objects using a camera.

Step 2: Install the TJ Bot SDK on Raspberry Pi

To work with the TJ Bot SDK, you'll need to install some dependencies. If you're using Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

    Install Node.js: Run the following commands to install Node.js on your Raspberry Pi:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Clone the TJ Bot repository: Clone the TJ Bot GitHub repository that contains all the necessary SDK files:

git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/tjbot.git
cd tjbot

Install dependencies: Once you've cloned the repository, install the required packages:

    npm install

Step 3: Set Up Watson Services

    Create Watson IoT Service:
        Go to your IBM Cloud Dashboard, and create a Watson IoT Platform service instance.
        Get the Device Credentials (Organization ID, Device Type, Device ID, Authentication Token).

    Create Watson Assistant (Optional):
        If you want your TJ Bot to understand and interact with users in natural language, you can create a Watson Assistant instance on IBM Cloud.
        Train your assistant with intents, entities, and dialog to respond to user inputs.

    Create Watson Speech to Text & Text to Speech (Optional):
        Create Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech services if you want TJ Bot to have speech capabilities.
        Get the API key and URL for both services.

    Create Watson Visual Recognition (Optional):
        If you're using a camera and want the bot to recognize objects, create a Visual Recognition instance on IBM Cloud.

Step 4: Configure the TJ Bot with Watson Services

In your cloned TJ Bot repository, navigate to the config.js file to configure the Watson services with the credentials you obtained earlier.

Example configuration:

module.exports = {
  "device": {
    "type": "raspberrypi",   // or other device types
    "id": "your_device_id",  // Replace with your Device ID
    "token": "your_device_token"  // Replace with your Authentication Token
  },
  "watson": {
    "speech_to_text": {
      "username": "your_speech_to_text_username",
      "password": "your_speech_to_text_password",
      "version": "2018-05-01"
    },
    "text_to_speech": {
      "username": "your_text_to_speech_username",
      "password": "your_text_to_speech_password",
      "version": "2018-05-01"
    },
    "assistant": {
      "assistant_id": "your_assistant_id",  // Watson Assistant ID
      "username": "your_assistant_username",
      "password": "your_assistant_password",
      "version": "2021-08-01"
    },
    "visual_recognition": {
      "username": "your_visual_recognition_username",
      "password": "your_visual_recognition_password",
      "version": "2018-03-19"
    }
  }
};

Step 5: Run the TJ Bot Application

Once everything is configured, you can run the TJ Bot application to interact with your IoT device using Watson services. The following script demonstrates using Watson Speech to Text and Text to Speech with TJ Bot.
Example Code: TJ Bot Using Watson Speech

const tjBot = require('tjbot');
const config = require('./config.js');

const hardware = ['microphone', 'speaker', 'camera']; // Configure based on your device capabilities
const tj = new tjBot.TJBot(hardware, config.device, config.watson);

// Function to listen to speech
function listenAndRespond() {
  tj.listen((err, text) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error("Error during speech recognition", err);
      return;
    }

    console.log(`Heard: ${text}`);

    // Send the recognized text to Watson Assistant
    tj.ask(text)
      .then(response => {
        console.log("Assistant's response: " + response.output.text[0]);
        // Convert the assistant's response to speech
        tj.speak(response.output.text[0]);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.error("Error with Assistant", err);
      });
  });
}

// Start listening to speech input
listenAndRespond();

Explanation of the Code:

    TJBot Initialization:
        The TJBot is initialized with the hardware devices (microphone, speaker, and camera). You can change these depending on your device setup.
        The configuration file config.js contains the credentials and settings for the Watson services.

    Speech to Text:
        The bot listens for speech input using the listen() method.
        Once speech is converted to text, it's sent to Watson Assistant for natural language understanding.

    Assistant Response:
        Watson Assistant responds to the input based on its trained data (intents, entities, and dialogs).
        The response from Watson Assistant is then converted back to speech using Watson Text to Speech.

    Running the Bot:
        The bot continuously listens for user speech, processes the input through Watson Assistant, and speaks back a response.

Step 6: Expand the IoT Application

You can extend your TJ Bot project by adding other Watson capabilities, such as:

    Visual Recognition: Use a camera to detect objects and classify them using Watson Visual Recognition.
    Watson IoT Platform: You can connect additional IoT devices (e.g., sensors, actuators) to Watson IoT Platform to manage and interact with them.
    AI-based Actions: Use Watson AI to create custom actions based on user input or environmental factors (e.g., trigger a smart light when certain conditions are met).

Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use IBM Watson IoT, Watson Assistant, and Watson Speech to Text/Text to Speech to create a simple interactive IoT bot (TJ Bot) that can understand and respond to voice commands. The TJ Bot acts as a platform for exploring the integration of various Watson AI services with IoT devices, making it a powerful tool for prototyping smart, AI-driven applications.

You can expand this project to add more sensors, devices, and Watson services to create more sophisticated AI-powered IoT solutions.
